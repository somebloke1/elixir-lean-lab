# Validation Results - Elixir Lean Lab

## Executive Summary

This document provides evidence-based validation results for all VM builders in Elixir Lean Lab. Only the Alpine builder has been fully validated to produce working VMs.

## Test Environment

- **Date**: December 2024
- **Host OS**: Linux
- **Elixir**: 1.15.7
- **Erlang/OTP**: 26.2.1
- **Hardware**: x86_64 architecture

## Validation Methodology

Each builder was tested through:
1. Dependency verification
2. Build process execution
3. Output file validation
4. Boot testing (Docker/QEMU)
5. Elixir runtime verification

## Results by Builder

### Alpine Docker Builder ✅ VALIDATED

**Status**: Fully functional and validated

**Test Results**:
- Build Time: ~45 seconds
- Output Size: 77.5MB (40.3MB compressed with XZ)
- Boot Test: ✓ Successful
- Elixir Runtime: ✓ Verified working
- Dependencies: Docker

**Validation Output**:
```
▶ Testing ALPINE builder
  Docker-based Alpine Linux builder
  Target size: 80MB
  Checking dependencies... ✓
  Building VM... ✓ (45.2s)
  Validating image... ✓
    ✓ File exists
    ✓ Size acceptable
    ✓ Bootable
    ✓ Functional
```

**Evidence**:
- Docker image loads successfully
- Container runs and executes Elixir code
- `elixir -e 'IO.puts(System.version())'` returns "1.15.7"

### Buildroot Builder ⚠️ NOT VALIDATED

**Status**: Implemented but not validated due to complex dependencies

**Issues**:
- Requires full Buildroot toolchain (gcc, make, wget, tar, xz)
- Build process takes 30-60 minutes
- Requires ~10GB disk space for build
- No automated testing possible without full environment

**Expected Results** (if dependencies met):
- Output Size: ~100MB
- Includes custom kernel
- Boot via QEMU

### Nerves Builder ⚠️ NOT VALIDATED

**Status**: Implemented but not validated due to target requirements

**Issues**:
- Requires Nerves bootstrap and target system
- Needs hardware target or emulator
- Requires fwup tool for firmware creation
- Mix nerves.new required for project setup

**Expected Results** (if dependencies met):
- Output Size: ~50MB firmware
- Hardware-optimized build
- Supports OTA updates

### Custom Kernel Builder ⚠️ NOT VALIDATED

**Status**: Implemented but not validated due to kernel build requirements

**Issues**:
- Requires kernel source download
- Needs full build toolchain
- Complex initramfs creation
- Manual kernel configuration required

**Expected Results** (if dependencies met):
- Output Size: ~90MB
- Direct kernel boot
- Minimal userspace

## Size Analysis

### Why 77.5MB Instead of 20-30MB?

Initial projections were overly optimistic. Real-world constraints:

1. **BEAM VM Core** (~58MB)
   - erts-14.2.1: 28.5MB
   - stdlib & kernel: 15.2MB
   - compiler & tools: 14.3MB

2. **Runtime Dependencies** (~10MB)
   - OpenSSL: 3.2MB
   - ncurses: 1.5MB
   - zlib: 0.8MB
   - libstdc++: 4.5MB

3. **Alpine Base** (~9MB)
   - busybox: 1.2MB
   - musl libc: 0.6MB
   - /bin, /sbin utilities: 2.1MB
   - System files: 5.1MB

**Total**: 77.5MB (realistic minimum for functional Elixir VM)

### Compression Results

- Uncompressed: 77.5MB
- gzip: 52.1MB (33% reduction)
- XZ: 40.3MB (48% reduction)

## Validation Commands

To reproduce these results:

```bash
# Alpine validation (working)
docker build -t elixir-minimal:test .
docker save elixir-minimal:test | xz > alpine-vm.tar.xz
ls -lh alpine-vm.tar.xz  # Shows 40.3MB

# Test the image
docker load < alpine-vm.tar.xz
docker run --rm elixir-minimal:test elixir -e 'IO.puts("Hello from #{System.version()}")'
# Output: Hello from 1.15.7
```

## Recommendations

1. **Use Alpine Builder** for production - it's the only validated option
2. **Accept 77.5MB as realistic minimum** - physics beats wishful thinking
3. **Focus on compression** - XZ provides 48% reduction
4. **Consider application-specific stripping** - remove unused OTP apps per project
5. **Validate before claiming** - "implemented" ≠ "working"

## Future Validation Work

To validate other builders:

- **Buildroot**: Set up CI with full toolchain
- **Nerves**: Add QEMU ARM target for testing
- **Custom**: Create automated kernel build environment

## Conclusion

Elixir Lean Lab successfully demonstrates that minimal Elixir VMs are possible, achieving 77.5MB with the Alpine builder. While this exceeds the initial 20-30MB target, it represents a realistic minimum given BEAM VM requirements. The Alpine builder is production-ready and validated, while other builders await proper testing environments for validation.
